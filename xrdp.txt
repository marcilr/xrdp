xrdp

Based on the work of FreeRDP[1] and rdesktop[2], xrdp uses the
remote desktop protocol to present a GUI to the user.

The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional
Linux terminal server, capable of accepting connections
from rdesktop, freerdp, and Microsoft's own terminal
server / remote desktop clients.

Unlike Windows NT/2000/2003/2008/2012 server, xrdp will 
not display a Windows desktop but an X window desktop to
the user.

Xrdp uses Xvnc or X11rdp to manage the X session.  To learn
